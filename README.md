Talk to me in English (previously "Answer in English(AIE)"

A streamlined app for students at my school to carry out brief written assignments
from home.

## Key aims:

-protect and promote child welfare at all times
-promote relatively rapid creation of written English
-promote risk taking when using language
-create an extremely simple user interface with the minimal possible options to
avoid confusion amoungst younger users

## Child Welfare & Pedagogical Rationale

1. Only allow teachers/admin to create posts for students to respond to. This ensures
   on-topic communication within a range of suitable topics both developmentally and linguistically

2. Only allow teachers/admin to edit and delete posts in order to reduce abuse/bullying. There are well documented cases of users of forums addeding abusive or questionable content only to remove it before complaints are make or action can be taken.
   -The best learners make mistakes. Enforcing errors to stay on the app is a step to teaching that errors are a perfectly normal part of language learning and nothing to feel
   ashamed off - something we develop in class time every day.
   -Errors can be used to inform later teaching objectives and as thus are important

3. Not to require email or real name to register. Many children do not have access to email due to parental decisions on the matter. Full names should not be stored online unless required. The unique sign up code will suffice for indentification if needed.

4. Unique joining code - all students will be required to use a unique code when registering. This will protect the students from non-students joining and possibly carrying out bullying etc.

5. Allow students to choose an username without teacher input. Usernames allow children to express themselves, protect their identity at a basic level. Having teachers complete sign up takes valuable classtime, reduces student participation and makes them self-aware
   of their username. Teachers can and should guide students on issues such as online identity as part of the onboarding process. Also learning to sign up for a site is part of the learning process. The unique signup code allows for identication if required by staff.

6. Show posts without having students sign in. Students will be more likely to be motivated by a list of current topics rather than a blank sign in screen. Student comments and names are hidden behind the sign in screen.

## Technical Rationale

1. CRA is perfect for this site as it requires no SEO, it is an 'in-house' site for students only.
2. "Roll your own" authentication is best for a system that cannot use students emails for password resets etc.

## Scripts
